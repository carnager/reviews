&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariana Grande is one of those Disney kids that started to sing on TV when
they were still children. Normally they start playing some role in a
disgusting TV series and at some point start a solo career as a singer,
where they soon leave behind their Teenager image and become sluts that
sing about nothing but sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariana is no exception here, though she hasn't reached the slut state yet.
At least not totally, there is one song on this album which might give a hint
where things will move on her next album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound wise Ariana was and is always compared with Mariah Carey. A comparison
that lacks substance, because while Ariana has an impressive and unique voice,
just like Mariah has, the overall sound is very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On her debut album, Ariana played hugely 90s inspired pop music.
Album number 2 sounds different. It's modern, best to be heard on the track
"Break Free" which is an EDM song featuring Zedd. If you hate this genre, don't listen
to this song, because you will not be able to get it out of your head.
The other single of the album is "Problem" another song, one might find annoying after a
while, but it's definately an ear catcher.
Those two songs, together with "Bang Bang" are obvious single releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the album has more to offer. Right between those singles "One Last Time" and "Why Try"
are placed, bringing a more conventional sound. And Ariana delivers. This is the
stuff classic pop songs are made of.
"Love me harder", feat. The Weekend  goes into a similar direction, fantastic hook, one for
the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course being compared to Mariah Carey brings the need for huge ballads. And indeed the album
has some great moments to offer. "Best Mistake" is a great example for a good ballad, if it weren't
for the male rapper, that seems to be essential for any pop album nowadays. Too bad, Ariana would
sound much better on her own.
"Just a little bit of your heart" is the second big moment on the record. An easy song,
but with huge effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't a single really bad track on this album, but one that has to be mentioned on its own.
"Hands on me" is what sadly has to be expected from every Disney-grown female artist at some point
in her career. Yes, it's a slut song. And no, she shouldn't do it, it doesn't suit her. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, "My Everything" does most things right and if there is one thing one has to critizise, it's
the fact that there are too many features on this album. Ariana is one, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; biggest voice
in pop music right now, she does not need support by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wish I could go back to the nineties just to crawl in old record stores again.
With my knowledge of music nowadays there are surely some gems I haven't bothered checking out
back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystery Machine is one of those bands. They haven't even been unsuccesful. In Canada their first
two albums sold quite good and they even were nominated for the Much Music Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystery Machine released 3 albums back in the days and then went on hiatus just to return in 2012
to release another album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Speed was their second effort and together with their debut "Graced" marked their peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soundwise Mystery Machine are a child of their times. The influences are obvious. Grunge, Noise Rock,
Shoegaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Mystery Machine sets apart from many bands is their potential to find the right balance between
edgy and accessible, distorted rockers and half acoustic hymns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band also shows, why todays alternative rock is in large parts so bloody boring in comparison.
Where todays bands rely on riffing only, bands back then played lots of little leads, clean or noisy.
This keeps a song from sounding mundayne, instead something new awaits the listener after each segment.
This is what makes great albums, there is actually something to discover and it's too much to grasp it all
on first listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that last statement made you think about Dinosaur Jr. then you got the first obvious comparison just
right. J. Mascis' band surely was an influence for this band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really isn't anything wrong with this album. Slower tunes such as "Sinker" with its great guitar final
go hand in hand with straight out rockers like the brilliant opener "Pound for Pound".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly the band members consider themselves as a shoegaze band. Personally I am missing the obvious
trademark sounds from this genre and rather see Mystery Machine as a Noise Rock band. In the end it doesn't
matter, both genres are closely related and as long as the result is of such high quality as in this case,
who am I to complain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while a flashback like this shows what has been missing from the majority of music in recent times,
luckily there have been a few bands rediscovering these sounds, like Dead Confederate or
Cheatahs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystery Machine on the other hand are one of the originals. It just happens that some never heard of them.
Even more glad I am now, that I had the chance of discovering these guys 20 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelly Furtado is a canadian singer who most likely does not need an introduction.
She sold 40 million records to date and had numerious top charting songs by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My introduction to Nelly was this very album back in 2003. I didn't think it was bad
but it also never stroke me as particulary good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well last year I gave it another try and it clicked. Not only is it enjoyable, it is
actually a special album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us straight to the sound of the album. Because "Folklore" indeed sounds different
to your regular Pop album. A lot of acoustic guitars and percussive rhythms lead your through
the total  time of roughly 50 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First song "One Trick Pony" with its banjo background instantly shows off with its folk elements,
which continues in track 2, which was my first introduction to the album. This one actually sounds
a little bit like Alanis Morissette - and again, banjo sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Explode" has kind of an electro-pop vibe to it, long before this kind of genre established itself.
Its instantly followed by "Try" - one of the singles from this album. And it was a single for a reason
A sweet acoustic-guitar driven song, with a refrain one cannot resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this way the album continues. More electronic songs follow the more folky ones until the album hits
its peak with "Picture Perfect". This song is in a league of its own. This song has it all. Great drums,
a nice guitar lead and an overall fantastic atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Grass is Green" sounds like Sia, long before she was even known to anyone and after the album
played through you realise: This is pretty good. It's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly Nelly changed style on her next album and never was able to return to this quality again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about music is that once in a while you will be surprised. Lately I had quite a lot of these moments
and Flower is responsible for one such occasion. Browsing some 90s related blog site I listened through some of
the mentioned bands and the first seconds of Flower made it clear to me: This might be one of those albums.
After all these years that feeling has become somewhat reliable and it turns out Flower is indeed a band that
produced 2 classic albums. Far away from the eyes of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concrete Sky is a compilation album, which features both of Flowers' full length albums on a single disc, released
by Simple Machines in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it I am raving about? Classic Noise Rock. If Sonic Youth during their Daydream Nation period is something
that appeals to you, believe me, this will too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flower's albums both sounded simliar, but still there was some noticable differences between the two.
The first nine tracks of the compilation was originally released as "Concrete".
The songs are mostly straight forward indie rock, very momoriable with good production and
if you need a comparison, it's probably Pixies and The Wedding present that need to be mentioned.
But yes, Sonic Youth lurk around the corner, which can be prominently heard on track 3 "Hologram Sky" or track 5 "Memorial Day".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From track 10 on their original "Hologram Sky" fills the rest of the disc. Production is tighter than on their debut album,
guitars are punchier and with "Ohio" you will find the first real actual hit. Well, if the world was a fair place to be, at least.
The bass is also more prominent than on Flowers' first outing. the vocals are more argessive, I dare say it: This has a grungy sound to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then comes the revelation. From "Magick" onwards this might well be a Daydream Nation tribute album. And I mean this in the best possible way.
It's no rip-off, but songwriting and style are very similar to that classic Noise album.
Edgy, playful, and you will find yourself not being able to get those tunes out of your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What remains? Well, Concrete Sky is a &lt;em&gt;must have&lt;/em&gt; for any Noise Rock fan. It's that easy and I consider their albums total classics already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Girls aloud are manufactured bubblegum pop - but they are awesome"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember very well reading this on some youtube video. And I couldn't
agree more.
Yes, they didn't write any of their songs (In fact every one of them was
written by songwriter ensemble Xenomania).
Yes, they emerged from a reality-TV show and most likely were chosen purely
by looks.&lt;br /&gt;
So what is there to like?&lt;br /&gt;
Quite a lot actually...&lt;br /&gt;
First of all Xenomania were consistent with their musical direction. While
Girls Aloud definately was a pop group, they always had these odd influences
noone expects from such an act. Quite a lot of their songs are straight out
rockers and breathe a healthy dose of punk rock in the best possible way.
This reminds the listener of the Go-Go's, whose main singer should be well known:
Belinda Carlisle.&lt;br /&gt;
While none of the girls had a charisma half as big as Ms. Carlisle, the group
as a whole managed to appear ironic, fun to be with and sometimes even a tiny bit
critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Punk. There I said it.&lt;br /&gt;
No Girls Aloud were no punk, but they delivered some kind of attitude, which
combined with the witty, fun lyrics completed an image of actual rock chicks.&lt;br /&gt;
The album starts off with "Models", an eccentric track with this typical
Xenomania vibe. Its basically a very modern version of the 80s, but without the
bombast. More Post-Punk than New Wave. Without the punk of course.&lt;br /&gt;
It's followed by a song that might very well be the best pop song of the whole
new millenium thus far. Classic Blues-Rock lead, and a refreain thats just one
thing: fun. Nothing deep, no experiements, but fun and that's all one could ask
for from a good pop song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the album continues in a similar fashion. Upbeat, rock-influenced
tunes, with catchy melodies (Watch Me Go), 60s influenced
rock song (Waiting), even somewhat experimental songs (Swinging London Town).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course a proper girl-band needs some ballads too. And Xenomania delivered here,
too. "Wild Horses" and "Whole Lotta History" are well executed and you might
catch yourself humming along those melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's the verdict here? Chemistry is a very entertaining record that doesn't get
boring at all. While the girls had funnier (and even critical) lyrics on later
albums, the overall quality of this one was never matched again. At least if you
come from a proper rock background, like I do. Chemistry was their most rocking
effort, but honestly: Every album was quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not close-minded and the obvious manufacturing aspect doesn't put you
off, give this album a try, it's in all seriousness a great listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siobhán Donaghy is best known, because she founded the Sugababes together with
Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan. They only released one album in that particular
setup. After that Siobhán left the band and soon started her solo career.
She released one album (Revolution in Me) which had a few minor hits.
In 2007 she returned with "Ghosts" and while an absolute critics favorite
it only sold around 3000 units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3000 sold discs. That's an awful low for an artist that once was part of one
of the most successful girlbands around. It's even worse considering how much
effort she put into this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it about this album that makes it that special? Well for a start:
it's quirky. Maybe Siobhán was on drugs, which we all know is the best thing
one can do when recording music.
The whole album feels out-of-place, airy, ghostly. This is espacially true
for the title track, with its backward recorded vocals. That fact in itself is
already worth mentioning, but the song sounds totally accessible at the same
time. It's one of those songs others would kill for. If you don't care for this
album, get it for this track alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean that the rest of the album falls short. While sounding a bit
more traditional (but still keeping this strange, odd atmosphere), every single
song simply is a little gem of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with "Don't Give It Up", a song with a huge Kate Bush feel
to it. Trippy drums and layered vocals, in combination with this floating keyboard
floor, give a hint, what kind of journey the listener is about to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So You Say" was released as a single, a good choice, the refrain won't let go
off you for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album, while twisted, has an overall happy feeling to it, but it's the kind
of self-reflected happiness that doesn't try to force itself onto others.
It sounds satisfied, like someone who is in peace with oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be it the Massive Attack influenced "Halcyion Days" or the Ray-of-Light-like
"Goldfish", the once-again-kate-bush-influenced "Medevac" or the acoustic-guitar-driven
"12 Bar Acid Blues", Donaghy makes sure the listener is pleased through out
the whole album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was not rewarded. 3000 sold units are not enough for an artist who
wants to live from the music. And because she was pretty sure she wouldn't be
able to top this album, she went on musical hiatus. Too bad, but she was probably
right about that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a minor flaw with this album: Once again itunes stepped in and reserved
an exclusive bonus track, which you cannot find legally anymore.
"Man on a Mission" is well worth owning, but sadly one is forced to rip it off
of youtube. And while we are at it: There are quite some B-sides on the singles
from this album. Every one of them is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not quite as great as this album though, which is a definite 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saint Saviour, or Becky Jones, received a bigger audience after 2009, when she
was the lead singer for Groove Armada. Around the same time she started her
solo careeer, releasing 2 EPs and her first album in 2012.
On that album many compared her to Kate Bush, which was relatively justified.
"Union" was a partly rocking, partly electronic album with quite some epic hymns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Becky released her second album. "In the Seams" it's called and I expected
another Kate Bush influenced album. My expectations were totally wrong.
When I first skipped through the album it seemed to be a real lackluster.
Gone are the guitars, gone are the drums. It's only about her this time.
Vocals with some piano tones and a bit of violins (played by  Manchester Camerata Orchestra -
another former band of Becky).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't make the same mistake I did. Don't skip through the album hastily. Give it
a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; listen. Dim the lights, turn up the volume and sink in.
And suddenly you realise: This is a thing of beauty. And it even has a clear
comparison: If you liked last year's Agnes Obel album, you most likely will love
this one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saint Saviour knows how to create lovely melodies. Some of them will surely stick
with you for days. Take the wonderful "Let It Go". A simple 2-tone piano and then
her voice kicks in, building an image, a scenery of autumn, most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it short: If melancholy, sophisticated pop music is your thing, get this.
But take your time with this one, its not background music.
Not because it's challenging, it rather wants to be found and then demands your
full attention.
In some louder moments (like in the mentioned Let It Go) even Sophie Hunger
might be a valid comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gosh, I very remember, when Christina Aguilera hit the scene.
Her huge hit "Genie in a bottle" was inescapable and boy, I hated it with a passion.
The music was the typical pop of the times and Ms. Aguilera herself also didnt strike
me as very attractive (as if that matters).
The following years I was without a TV so whatever happened to her and her music
didn't reach me.
Well apart from "Beautiful" from this very album, which I always liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't even tell when or why, but Spotify recommended this album to me and sice this was
a time I opened up to some Pop I gave it a try - and was pleasantly surprised.
Normally this kind of music needs a lot of listens for me, simply because it's not my
cup of tea. But "Stripped" immediately captured my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one unbelievably bad songs on this record and it was even released as the first single ("Dirrty").
The song and the video are so crap and cheap critics smashed it for good reasons.
The collaboration with Redman did the rest for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the actual album sounds nothing like that song. There are two more features here:
Lil Kim raps on "Can't Hold Us Down" (I could have done with this part) and Alicia
Keys plays piano on her self-written song "Impossible". (Which is a definite highlight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no clearly defined sound on this album. The album starts off with the mentioned
Lil Kim feature, which shines with its slight influences from the rap culture.
It is followed by "Walk Away" which is a breathtaking song. It's a ballad, that is
driven by a rather simple piano hook and a rather jazzy tone. Ballads, as it turns out
are what Christina does best. This one is one for the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is followed by a rather surprising song. "Fighter". Surprising because it's a pure Rock Song.
Relatively heavy guitars create the base for this satisfying song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genre roundabout goes on and the next songs go from flamenco ("Infatuation") over pure urban
("Loving Me 4 Me") to "Impossible" which I mentioned above. It's no big surprise that
this one sounds like an Alicia Keys song and that in itself makes it a gem. But
Aguilera makes one thing clear: She can sing. Really sing. It's such a joy to hear her
create melodies, changing from soft to rough voice and back again. On later albums
(and especially live) she overdid the singing. Here it's just spot-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlights and genres don't stop here. "Underappreciated" is a funk song full of hooks
and is followed by the best-known song of this album. "Beautiful" is just that.
Even the Lemonheads were captured by this song and covered it on one of their albums.
A modern evergreen and nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's followed by the indie-rock hymn "Make Over" and two Soul songs, all plain brilliant.
"Soar" builds up intensely building up to an impressive choir-driven ascendo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the disgusting "Dirrty" the album ends with three highlights.
"A Voice within" is a pop-ballad in the veins of Mariah Carey and it's possibly one of the
best ballads ever written. (By the way, you've got to watch the video for this one, she
looks stunning)
I'm OK is another acoustic guitar driven ballad and another highlight, before the album ends
with the last number. Another Soul song, which again builds up nicely and leaves the listener
very satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all: The lyrics on this album are partly sultry, but never dumb (with the mentioned exception).
Most times they are even serious, trying to take a shot on society issues.
While Aguilera will never be an activist, it's a brave step to even try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway - if you have just the slightest open spot for good pop music, get this one.
If it weren't for the one song, I'd call this a perfect album.
But since this leaves 15 great to brilliant songs (three songs are interludes/intros) I can't help but
to give this one a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cult of Luna. This band has been around since the early 2000s. Rising from the
ashes of Hardcore band Umeå, they played slow and aggressive doom metal, which
incorperated more and more elements of Post-Rock into their sound.
Nowadays they are seen as one of the leaders of the whole Post-Metal scene.
Vertikal is their sixth album to date and it's probably their most accessible one, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me admit it. "Vertikal" is my first Cult of Luna album.
Let me also get this straight. It's good. It's so good that I got their
back catalogue as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one should characterize Cult of Luna's Sound, "aggressive"
and maybe "disturbing" will most likely be words you hear.
And initially I would agree. The guitars have a somewhat dirty sound, the overall
tempo is sluggish and the vocals consist of roars rather than singing.
But something else is there. It's not instantly recognizable, while the first song
is playing. In fact it's not evident until the second song "Vicarious Redemption"
hits the eleven minute mark. That's the moment when you suddenly hear a hint of dubstep
which is soon replaced by a lead guitar line that sticks with you instantly.
This line is accompanied by a building up of sounds - several layers of guitars, some keyboards
and then... the harmonies end again.
But this moment marks the first point one can relate to, if new to this kind of sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next instant moment is probably the song "In Awe of".
Here the situation is different though. While not really different from the rest of
the material, this one is an instant ear-catcher. The keyboards creating the base
for the haunting atmosphere, again accompanied by aggressive vocals. But it seems
more strucutred than previous songs. And what is this? A vocal melody around the 4 minute mark.
The only one on the whole record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you managed to cope with the pressing nature of this record, you will soon come back
for another round. And start to notice all those small melodies hidden in the
layered guitars. You begin to realise that those riffs are quite catchy and
that the missing verse-chorus-verse structure is actually what makes this kind of music
interesting. Welcome to world of Post-Metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sets Cult of Luna apart from others of their kind?
They can write interesting song strucutres for a start. At least three songs on this
record are outstanding (I: The Weapon, Vacarious Redemption, In Awe of), the rest is still
pretty damn good.
For me this was the best Post-Rock/Metal release of 2013, right behind
Russian Circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I should start listening to their older records...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jewel released Pieces of You in 1995 she became everyone's darling
with her Singer/Songwriter songs that seemed too authentic to be fake.
And indeed, there was much of Jewel herself in those songs. Being homeless for
quite a while and singing in cheap pubs to earn a few cents, while not having
any contact with her family - that was Jewel's life back then. That street
credibility made her real. She refused a big check for her record deal and tried
to be herself.
Success came quickly - to everyone's surprise in a time when the endtimes of Grunge
and the rising of Britpop dominated the music scene. Infact Jewel became so
succesful that the big Bob Dylan asked her to go on tour with him.
As the story goes Bob has told her to remain exactly the way she was. "Don't
play their game - be yourself" Jewel quoted him on a Howard Stern interview.
She did not listen to him and on her second album "Sprit" one could hear quite
some Pop/Rock influences. Did that hurt her music? Not yet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, quite the contrary. While "Pieces of You" might have been Jewel's most
(and probably only) personal record, "Spirit" earns a lot from some of the best
Songwriting the 90s had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all this is an album in the vein of Sarah McLachlan, maybe a bit more quiet
at most times. But where Sarah made pure Rock/Pop in her greatest days, there is
something on this album that is different. An essence of the record reaches out
and tries to remind you why this album is indeed special.
The irony: While being far more commercial than its predecessor this album is
once again influenced by a dying music scene, by incorperating elements of the Seattle
style.&lt;br /&gt;
No, this is not a Rock album, but the overall mood and the
guitar playing always make me picture images of "&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105415"&gt;Singles&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her style of singing hasn't changed from the debut album, but all seems more polished
and tighter produced. Some called it overproduced, but I don't agree, the production
of this album fits the music just perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's recap. Melancholy songs driven by some of the nicest guitar picking with
a voice that can actually sing. But what about the songs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album could be categorized into two parts: Radio friendly songs, Rock songs, if you like
and those down-to-the-minum songs that made her debut great already.
"Deep Water", "Hands", "Down So Long" fall into the first category and the last two
had been released as singles - "Hands" being one of her most prominent songs.
By the way, the video for "Down So Long" proves the Seattle influence being
a very typical video for that particular time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the album is compiled from those other songs, the quiet ones that you
overhear easily on first listen.
"Kiss the Flame" is a prime example for such a song. Nothing special going on.
A very minimal acoustic guitar is played to some ambient Keyboard floor.
And Ms. Kilcher sings. Then suddenly she forms a melody with nothing more than those
three words that define the title. And once this new creation finds the listener, it
won't be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's in a nutshell, what describes this album best: Small gems hidden in small
melodies and guitar licks. It never sounds special. But it is, once those gems
have found a place in your memory. Which they will. Not on first listen. Maybe not
on second either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we all know the best albums are not those sticking from the start, but
those that need to be worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Spirit" needed a few years for me and from then on it never left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from the moment it arrived it was clear, this is one for the island,
a close friend that deserves to have a spot in my personal list of classics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do Peter Mengede, Tom Capone and Pete Hines have in common, apart from the
fact that you probably don't know their names?
Well for one, they all played in bands, you most likely DO know, if hardcore is
something you can relate to.
Let's drop the names: Helmet, Cro-Mags, Quicksand, Murphy's Law. Sounds familar?
It should. If not, there is some catch-up to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing with rock-supergroups is, that they are normally quite boring.
Not brave enough to do their own thing, not creative enough to step out of their
main bands' shadow. It's a mix of individuals that haven't played before and that
reflects in the songs. Normally, because Handsome were different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not different in the sense that they sounded unlike anything else they did before.
But they sure were different, quality-wise.
Let's start by answering the obvious. Is this a hardcore album? To answer this
let's take a quick look at their past bands.
There is Helmet, always labeled Hardcore, but in reality they were a Noiserock
band with a tendency to heavy riffing.
Then there is Cro-Mags, a band noone ever was able to clearly categorize as either
Metal or Hardcore.
Quicksand is probably the closest to a Hardcore band, but even they were... different.
If you really need to compare Handsome with its members former bands, it mostly sounds
like a mixture of Helmet-like riffing, paired with Quicksands way of creating
melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production on this thing is very tight. Sharp drums, Noisy, but clear and heavy
guitars, create the sound fundament for this 46 minute trip.
Most songs have somewhat epic refrains, which makes it easy to remember them.
"Needles", "Thrown Away" or "Dim the Lights" are obvious hits and it really makes you
wonder, why this band never took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one weak spot in Handsomes sound, it's the vocals. Jeremy Chatelain has
kind of a weak voice, spot on with the melodies, but lacking in charisma.
But this is easily compensated by the quality of the song material on this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are into hardcore bands like the ones mentioned, I highly recommend to listen
to this thing. I give it a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and consider this a personal classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite ironic. Most people have probably not heard a song sung by Sia in their lifetime.
And even if, it was most likely some guest vocals for another artist.
Yet, I bet around everyone has heard at least one Sia song.
She is responsible for a ***load of huge hits from the last decade.
Beyoncé, Rihanna, Rita Ora, Kate Perry. Is there anyone that doesn't know these names? Well rest assured, Sia has written at least some of their hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she also has an impressive back catalog of albums, which span from Singer/Songwriter
over Rock to pure Pop. And it's all very convincing.
Maybe this is the reason why the booklet never shows Sia's face.
It's always just an empty spot. People have heard her songs, but they connect it to another person.
Can this album change this fact? Probably not, Does it have the potential to do so? Definately yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first notes of Chandelier, the first single, open the album and if you know her older albums
you have to wonder: Is this really Sia? The opening sounds just like Rihanna. Both her voice and the style of urban rhythms are quite similar. Not the best sign.
Then after a short bridge, the refrain kicks in. And boy, what a hymn. It's that kind of song that leaves you speechless.
Her voice also sounds much better in the refrain, reaching for the high tones easily, but never getting weak.
The scheme repeats for a few times and this pop masterpiece is over. And that's when you think, the album can only go down from here. And it does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second song "Big Girls Cry" hits a similar tone, not quite as much pathos,
but still a very catchy refrain. Sia shows off her songwriting skills. Hearing these melodies you don't wonder for one moment, about her success as a ghost-writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use this moment to try to catch the essence of the sound on this album.
Close your eyes. Picture yourself in a hall full of people. The air is cool and music is playing. loud.
Its that kind of loudness that leaves echoes of the playing song. Reverb and bass are the key here - combined with a vocal delivery that seems to flow above everything else.
If this sounds retro to you, yes - this album captures the spirit of the 80s.
There always seems to be an echo of Sia's voice floating in the air. The drums keep vibrating.
Yet, this is not a retro album. Quite the contrary - this is a very modern release,
which is inspired by a specific era. And it just happens to be the one most prominent for its huge melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the same vein the tracks continue to flow until "Hostage", the 5th track gives us a break.
That's Sia we knew from her last record, the one doing rock songs with an attitude.
Still very catchy, but somewhat edgy. After 4 pop-hymns in a row "Hostage" takes the perfect slot on the album to relax the listener. Well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album goes straight back to the beginning. Pop songs, with a dark twist to it.
Very modern, but yet very reminiscent of the past. And it ends with the darkest song of the album and
yet another climax, before suddenly ending the journey with 6 simple piano notes going down. We are not flowing anymore, feet on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what remains in the end? 1000 Forms of Fear is a flawless pop record.
There is one thing that remains to be seen though. Records like this tend to age quickly.
We will see how well this album survives the test of time. But for now I give it a well deserved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know that feeling, when you listen to an artist and think you should
have known that artist earlier?
Charlotte Martin is one of those artists for me.
I first discovered her late 2012 and was instantly blown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading on the web I found out she is married to Ken Andrews, who on his behalf
fronts the alternative rock band "Failure", another great band i learned to love
far too late.
I also found out that she was often compared to Tori Amos, another great performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-sound"&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track that introduced me to Charlotte back then was "Limits of Our Love" from this very album.
This song has a definite Kate Bush feeling to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at this point I had 3 connection points to her music. Kate Bush, Failure and
Tori Amos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Your shore starts off with the title song and a strong piano hook, which as it
turns out, is a trademark of her music.
The style of piano playing is remarkable. Mentioned easy hooks get you, well - hooked,
while there is happening quite a lot in the lower registers.
After a few minutes the drums kick in and layered vocals make up the refrain.
There you have the typical Charlotte Martin song-formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounded negative, be assured, it isn't. The fact she found her typical
style of song, does - by no means - conclude her writing the same song over and over again.
No, quite the oposite, her predictive way of writing songs results in equally high
quality to all her outputs so far. And especially this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's with the influences? Tori Amos is, of course, an obvious comparison.
Piano, drums, no fear of using the lower half of her instrument. Yes, there are
a lot of similarities here.
But where Tori tends to sound weird at times Charlotte always captures the
right amount of Pop-appeal. Is it pop though?
Stand-out track "Limits of Our Love" begs to differ. Triple drumming and
a rather dark atmosphere make this more a goth-hymn than your typical pop song.
Without the clichees, that is. And I said it before. This could be a Kate Bush
song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves the 3rd connection, Failure. Well, rest assured, Charlotte Marting is
not a rock artist. But her sound shows a lot of love for this genre.
The song "Steel" finishes with a piano/guitar final, that leaves nothing to be desired.
I am sure I would have enjoyed this even in my louder youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing has to be pointed out though: Charlotte Martin is definately not a copy cat.
Yes, there are similarities, but she mixes those to her own musical cocktail
in such a captivating way, that I can only conclude with my final statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On a Shore" is a classic in every way. If you have missed it, use this day,
which marks it's 10 year anniversary. And once you fell in love with it,
dive into the rest of her discography, which is of equal quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10&lt;/p&gt;
