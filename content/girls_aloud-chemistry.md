### Introduction
"Girls aloud are manufactured bubblegum pop - but they are awesome"

I remember very well reading this on some youtube video. And I couldn't
agree more.
Yes, they didn't write any of their songs (In fact every one of them was
written by songwriter ensemble Xenomania).
Yes, they emerged from a reality-TV show and most likely were chosen purely
by looks.

So what is there to like?  
Quite a lot actually...  

First of all Xenomania were consistent with their musical direction. While
Girls Aloud definately was a pop group, they always had these odd influences
noone expects from such an act. Quite a lot of their songs are straight out
rockers and breathe a healthy dose of punk rock in the best possible way.
This reminds the listener of the Go-Go's, whose main singer should be well known:
Belinda Carlisle.  
While none of the girls had a charisma half as big as Ms. Carlisle, the group
as a whole managed to appear ironic, fun to be with and sometimes even a tiny bit
critical.

### The Sound
Anyway. Punk. There I said it.  
No Girls Aloud were no punk, but they delivered some kind of attitude, which
combined with the witty, fun lyrics completed an image of actual rock chicks.  
The album starts off with "Models", an eccentric track with this typical
Xenomania vibe. Its basically a very modern version of the 80s, but without the
bombast. More Post-Punk than New Wave. Without the punk of course.  
It's followed by a song that might very well be the best pop song of the whole
new millenium thus far. Classic Blues-Rock lead, and a refreain thats just one
thing: fun. Nothing deep, no experiements, but fun and that's all one could ask
for from a good pop song.

The majority of the album continues in a similar fashion. Upbeat, rock-influenced
tunes, with catchy melodies (Watch Me Go), 60s influenced
rock song (Waiting), even somewhat experimental songs (Swinging London Town).

Of course a proper girl-band needs some ballads too. And Xenomania delivered here,
too. "Wild Horses" and "Whole Lotta History" are well executed and you might
catch yourself humming along those melodies.

So, what's the verdict here? Chemistry is a very entertaining record that doesn't get
boring at all. While the girls had funnier (and even critical) lyrics on later
albums, the overall quality of this one was never matched again. At least if you
come from a proper rock background, like I do. Chemistry was their most rocking
effort, but honestly: Every album was quite fun.

If you are not close-minded and the obvious manufacturing aspect doesn't put you
off, give this album a try, it's in all seriousness a great listen.
