### Introduction

What do Peter Mengede, Tom Capone and Pete Hines have in common, apart from the
fact that you probably don't know their names?
Well for one, they all played in bands, you most likely DO know, if hardcore is
something you can relate to.
Let's drop the names: Helmet, Cro-Mags, Quicksand, Murphy's Law. Sounds familar?
It should. If not, there is some catch-up to do.

The thing with rock-supergroups is, that they are normally quite boring.
Not brave enough to do their own thing, not creative enough to step out of their
main bands' shadow. It's a mix of individuals that haven't played before and that
reflects in the songs. Normally, because Handsome were different.

### The Sound

Not different in the sense that they sounded unlike anything else they did before.
But they sure were different, quality-wise.
Let's start by answering the obvious. Is this a hardcore album? To answer this
let's take a quick look at their past bands.
There is Helmet, always labeled Hardcore, but in reality they were a Noiserock
band with a tendency to heavy riffing.
Then there is Cro-Mags, a band noone ever was able to clearly categorize as either
Metal or Hardcore.
Quicksand is probably the closest to a Hardcore band, but even they were... different.
If you really need to compare Handsome with its members former bands, it mostly sounds
like a mixture of Helmet-like riffing, paired with Quicksands way of creating
melodies.

The production on this thing is very tight. Sharp drums, Noisy, but clear and heavy
guitars, create the sound fundament for this 46 minute trip.
Most songs have somewhat epic refrains, which makes it easy to remember them.
"Needles", "Thrown Away" or "Dim the Lights" are obvious hits and it really makes you
wonder, why this band never took off.

If there is one weak spot in Handsomes sound, it's the vocals. Jeremy Chatelain has
kind of a weak voice, spot on with the melodies, but lacking in charisma.
But this is easily compensated by the quality of the song material on this album.

If you are into hardcore bands like the ones mentioned, I highly recommend to listen
to this thing. I give it a

9/10

and consider this a personal classic.
