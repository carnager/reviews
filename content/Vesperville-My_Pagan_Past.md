### Introduction
Say all you want about spotify, with all valid criticism it is a great ressource
for finding unknown bands.

Vesperville was one of the bands Spotify recommended to me and it was spot-on.
Researching a little I have learned that last.fm had less than 150 total plays.
24 of these were my scrobbles.
Now after giving it some more listens I can in all honesty say: What a waste.
These guys deserve a wider audience.

### The Sound
So what is to expect from this album? Judging by the low number of listeners it's probably
some obscure Black Metal? "My Pagan Past" - that sounds alarming.

The more surprising the moment, when you actually start listening to this record.
Vesperville combine Mid-Eighties Indie Rock with huge melodies.
But first the album kicks off with a tribute to New Wave, including keyboards and echo effects.

Song number 2 on the other hand is far more representable of the overall type of music.
