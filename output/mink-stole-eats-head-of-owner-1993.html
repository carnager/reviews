<p>Ian Spehr might be known to some as the vocalist of the band "Genepool" who play their own breed of Post-Punk.
What most won't know is that Spehr already fronted a band way back in the early 90s, which released their debut
album <em>Eats Head of Owner</em> in 93 and played a mixture of Noise Rock, Grunge and Hardcore. This debut mostly
focused on the accessible side of Noise Rock and produced some of the most memoirable tunes of the genre, which 
never got the recognition they should.</p>
<p>Mink Stole was very much a band of their time. Nirvana and the like were the shit and everyone jumped on the bandwagon
to get a piece of the cake. Most tried to copy Grunge music and some did so with great results. But Grunge also had
it's counterparts in Noise Rock, a genre that managed to stay away from the public eye with the exception of Sonic
Youth having their moment with 1992s <em>Dirty</em>. Apart from that the genre remained as independent as it should.</p>
<p>Mink Stole took a lot of inspiration from the Noise Rock movement but they combined it with the melodic appeal of
the exploding Grunge/Alternative machine. And the band manages to balance its two ingredients magnificiently.
While the record is full of hooks and production is more on the clean side of things, the band is able to hold on to
the underground spirit that surrounds the genre they offer in the first place.</p>
<p>The result is a collection of songs that actually sounds rather unique. There are influences all over the place, but
the way Mink Stole combine the strings works to their benefit. Album opener with the dissonance verses and playful
guitars, that suddenly boost in the chorus show right away where this journey is heading. Yes, this is noisy and
non-commercial and yet it has so much appeal that could have made this a much bigger success than it was.</p>
<p>And the album continues in similar fashion. There is no weak track on the record, yet there is a standout track to be
found. When <em>Pass</em> starts playing it's instantly obvious that this one is gonna be huge. More melody focused than
the rest of the album this is definately a contender for a proper single release. But it wasn't and neither were any
of the other 11 great tracks.</p>
<p>And when the last jam of nearly 8 minutes finished one can only wonder how many great albums might have been lost that
still want to be discovered. </p>
