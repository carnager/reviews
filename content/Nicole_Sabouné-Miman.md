Strictly spoken this isn't even a 2017 release, but Miman wasn't available for the unfortunates who don't live
in Sweden until now. Century Media saw the potential and is now distributing the album world wide. Hopefully
it will sell well so we will see a re-release of Nicole Sabounés first album too. Anyway, researching for her
I was quite surprised to find out that she was a contender for Swedens version of "X-Factor". Anyway, Miman
is not 08/15 Pop, this is the deep and meaningful version of The Cure and it's not only a hommage to Wave and
Post-Punk music - it demands a place up with the great classics.

The album starts with the slow building beauty *The Body*. A choir, a simple baseline, pummeling drums, reverb
and that special feel that made *Disintegration* such a special album. This opener makes it clear right from the start
where it is coming from. Then Sabouné starts to sing. Of course everyone will compare her to Siouxie Sioux, but
her strong and capable voice does not need comparisons to shine. The melodies are dark and catchy. This track does not
need a huge hook to be succesful of delivering its message, instead it manages to remain dense for the whole time.
A great opener that manages to wake curiosity for what else the album has in store.

*Right Track* hits similar tones and adds another layer in form of organs, which help developing the ghostly feeling
that surrounds this release, whereas *Bleeding Faster* sounds a bit like a Doom Metal song without the Metal. In theory
an easy song, with incredible intense atmosphere and a nearly choral like refrain. When Nicole starts shouting
"This is fucking outrageous" with a nearly child like voice, it once again adds another level of intensity.

*Under Stars* is a turning point for the album. It's the central ballad on the album. A simple song, which instrumentation
mainly supporting the vocal melody. Folowing this calming piece the album changes directions slightly. The vibe becomes
more upbeat. *Lifetime* and *Rips This World* have proper hooklines and might well be the singles of this piece, if those
were still a thing. *We are Losers* surprises with a different kind of bass sound, which gives the song a unique feel on 
the album and with *Withdraw* the album originally had its final moment. With 7 minutes this is by far the albums longest track.
It's also the most haunting one, sparsely scored with a slow build up this is a typical album closer.

But this re-release features another song. *Frozen* is a cover version of Madonnas classic from 1998 and while roughly staying
true to the original it adds some outstanding guitar work. While the original is already quite captivating, the drum sound, the
Western guitar sound and the doomy feel of this version make this interpretation a noteworthy one. With this track Nicole Sabouné
sounds closer to Anna von Hauswolff than The Cure.

What remains to be said in the end? Not much, but if you like your music dark or if Post-Punk or Gothic Rock hits a soft spot
this is a no-brainer. It plays in the very highest league of the genre and I am not afraid to mention it in one breath with
the likes of Cure's *Disintegration*. And even if you are not a fan of the genre, I urge you to give this one a try, it's just
too good to not at least give it a chance.
