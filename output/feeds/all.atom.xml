&lt;li&gt;Cut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nail Me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Dolving is mainly known for his vocal duties for &lt;em&gt;The Haunted&lt;/em&gt;, but before the Thrash institution
formed he was part of another band: Mary Beats Jane. They released their debut album in 1994 which was
a Metal infused version of Hardcore. Before the band called it quits in 1997 they released their second
and final album. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the band changed a lot since their debut album. Album opener &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; serves as an intro. Beeping noises
and fuzzy guitars build up and stop suddenly just to let the drums for the first actual song &lt;em&gt;Blackeye&lt;/em&gt; take over.
First thing noticable is the production which is far away from the Metal sound of the debut. This is still some kind
of Hardcore, but the influences are drawn from bands like Tool or maybe the Deftones and the band obviously also
got influenced by some Noisecore as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the influences seem obvious, the band manages to fully embrace their very own take on music, the drum and guitar
tone of &lt;em&gt;Locust&lt;/em&gt; was unique and still is to this very day, which is quite an archivement on its own. Even better the 
songs themselves haven't lost any of their original appeal. Third song &lt;em&gt;Pure&lt;/em&gt; should have been on heavy rotation on Indie
radio, same with the first actual single &lt;em&gt;Day In Day Out&lt;/em&gt;, which is the most obviously Tool-influenced track on the album.
But yet the band stayed under the radar. A shame. People missed out on the grooving and driving &lt;em&gt;Dogrelish&lt;/em&gt; and the adrenaline
injected &lt;em&gt;Flowered&lt;/em&gt; which is the most aggressive track on the album together with &lt;em&gt;Corrosion&lt;/em&gt; following it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they also missed beautiful numbers such as the acoustic favorite &lt;em&gt;Fall&lt;/em&gt; or the Jazz influenced closing track &lt;em&gt;Nail Me&lt;/em&gt; which
is nothing but a perfect closer for this album. And they missed the fantastic &lt;em&gt;Cradlewake&lt;/em&gt; which is a Psychedelic number perfectly
combining the best of nineties angst-driven rock music into one song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is an album full of highlights, which really should have been a much bigger success, It's noisy to the max, but remains
accessible at the same time. It's blood pumping and yet full of sensible moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Body&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Bleeding Faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under Stars (For the Lovers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifetime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rip This World&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We Are No Losers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdraw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frozen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strictly spoken this isn't even a 2017 release, but Miman wasn't available for the unfortunates who don't live
in Sweden until now. Century Media saw the potential and is now distributing the album world wide. Hopefully
it will sell well so we will see a re-release of Nicole Sabounés first album too. Anyway, researching for her
I was quite surprised to find out that she was a contender for Swedens version of "X-Factor". Anyway, Miman
is not 08/15 Pop, this is the deep and meaningful version of The Cure and it's not only a hommage to Wave and
Post-Punk music - it demands a place up with the great classics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album starts with the slow building beauty &lt;em&gt;The Body&lt;/em&gt;. A choir, a simple baseline, pummeling drums, reverb
and that special feel that made &lt;em&gt;Disintegration&lt;/em&gt; such a special album. This opener makes it clear right from the start
where it is coming from. Then Sabouné starts to sing. Of course everyone will compare her to Siouxie Sioux, but
her strong and capable voice does not need comparisons to shine. The melodies are dark and catchy. This track does not
need a huge hook to be succesful of delivering its message, instead it manages to remain dense for the whole time.
A great opener that manages to wake curiosity for what else the album has in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right Track&lt;/em&gt; hits similar tones and adds another layer in form of organs, which help developing the ghostly feeling
that surrounds this release, whereas &lt;em&gt;Bleeding Faster&lt;/em&gt; sounds a bit like a Doom Metal song without the Metal. In theory
an easy song, with incredible intense atmosphere and a nearly choral like refrain. When Nicole starts shouting
"This is fucking outrageous" with a nearly child like voice, it once again adds another level of intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under Stars&lt;/em&gt; is a turning point for the album. It's the central ballad on the album. A simple song, which instrumentation
mainly supporting the vocal melody. Folowing this calming piece the album changes directions slightly. The vibe becomes
more upbeat. &lt;em&gt;Lifetime&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rips This World&lt;/em&gt; have proper hooklines and might well be the singles of this piece, if those
were still a thing. &lt;em&gt;We are Losers&lt;/em&gt; surprises with a different kind of bass sound, which gives the song a unique feel on 
the album and with &lt;em&gt;Withdraw&lt;/em&gt; the album originally had its final moment. With 7 minutes this is by far the albums longest track.
It's also the most haunting one, sparsely scored with a slow build up this is a typical album closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this re-release features another song. &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt; is a cover version of Madonnas classic from 1998 and while roughly staying
true to the original it adds some outstanding guitar work. While the original is already quite captivating, the drum sound, the
Western guitar sound and the doomy feel of this version make this interpretation a noteworthy one. With this track Nicole Sabouné
sounds closer to Anna von Hauswolff than The Cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What remains to be said in the end? Not much, but if you like your music dark or if Post-Punk or Gothic Rock hits a soft spot
this is a no-brainer. It plays in the very highest league of the genre and I am not afraid to mention it in one breath with
the likes of Cure's &lt;em&gt;Disintegration&lt;/em&gt;. And even if you are not a fan of the genre, I urge you to give this one a try, it's just
too good to not at least give it a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There just isn't enough political Folk music around. The genre is filled with drinking songs,
stupid cover versions andinfantility and worst of all the general songwriting reflects this more often than not.
Musically most Folk Rock bands are either boring or try to be punks without any clue what is needed for a good Punk album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are exceptions, of course. The Levellers for example, the Oysterband too - at least parts of their career - and
Bleeding Hearts most definately belong in this list too. Sadly they are total underdogs, despite the fact that they supported
big names like The Darkness or above mentioned Oysterband. Their aproach to Folk is rooted in Punk Rock, which doesn't mean
they play it fast and straight forward, instead they take the attitude of bands like Social Distortion and Stiff Little Fingers
and wrap it in proper Folk songs mostly. Yes they rock, but they don't shove it down your throat. Most obvious their Punk influences
can be heard in vocalist &lt;em&gt;Foxie&lt;/em&gt;'s voice, which coincidentally reminds one of Mike Ness at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyrically the band points out Injustice, demands more love and tells little stories in a way that feels just right. No joking around
or flat accusations, instead it's all just a nicely wrapped up package, just like the music itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the band is able to write proper hits too, just listen to the outstanding track "Little Bit of Love" a tune so good, it's a shame
so few people get to hear it. Caravan Song is another highlight and the Polka influenced &lt;em&gt;Russian Girl&lt;/em&gt; shows that the band can mix
different styles of music without losing their trademark sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fly in the Face of Fashion&lt;/em&gt; is a great piece of Folk Rock from a band that deserves so much more attention, if Political awareness, well
made Folk and Punk music and a healthy bit of 70s attitude is your thing don't let this one slip you by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max Rieger is quite a figure in Stuttgarts music scene. Fronting the Noise-Rock band "Die Nerven" he released
a handful of full length albums and apart from his duty singing for his main band he produces around every
band for the Staatsakt label, which mainly focuses on a sound similar to his own band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All diese Gewalt however is a different kind of beast. Where Die Nerven know how to utilize distortion and dissonance
to create their sound, Rieger has chosen the other side of the spectrum for his second solo album.
Here beauty and calmness define the album. If Die Nerven are the german hommage to Sonic Youth, All diese Gewalt pay
tribute to The Cure and some of the more percussion heavy tracks by New Model Army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Album opener &lt;em&gt;Wie es geht&lt;/em&gt; sets the mood from the start. Somewhat synthetic sounding drums, a prominent bass and
guitars that always play along, but never steal the focus. And Max Rieger singing. No screams on this one, just
him providing lyrical content in nearly spoken word fashion. And at some point percussions start opening up the
sound. The guitars get some room and suddenly one remembers the Noise background of this project. But never does
this track - and album - lose its harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;Welt in Klammern&lt;/em&gt; succeeds is in the way a certain mood is transported. And as with every mood this one is
best enjoyed by being receptive for it. So dim the lights, get yourself cosy and do nothing else but listen.
I know this sounds cliché, but if there is one decade that is defined by clichés it's the eighties.
They were cheesy, they were full of bad taste and horrible culture - and some of the very best. And &lt;em&gt;All diese Gewalt&lt;/em&gt;
capture the latter perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't speak german, if Disintegration by the Cure means anything to you, this one could very well be a release
for heavy rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark. Once again Denmark. The amount of awesome danish bands I find lately is unbelievable. Baby Woodrose are another one of these
and are around since 2001. They started as a low-fi Psychedelic Rock band and quickly evolved to be one of the best names in modern
Psychedelic Rock. Over time more and more Space Rock elements enhanced their trademark sound and with &lt;em&gt;Third Eye Surgery&lt;/em&gt; the band
released their first proper Space Rock album. It comes with 9 tracks and delivers 37 minutes of joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with &lt;em&gt;Down to the Bottom&lt;/em&gt; which opens with a simple, yet effective guitar riff, a memoriable bass line and lots of hammond.
The moment Lorenzo Woodrose starts singing instantly resembles one big name in Space Rock and the name is Monster Magnet.
And yes, Monster Magnet might have been the biggest influence for this album, respectively their &lt;em&gt;Dopes to Infinity&lt;/em&gt; era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is quite a monument to get inspiration from  which personally ranks in my all time favorite album list. Any bands output will most likely have a hard
time being compared to such a landmark album. One thing is for certain: Baby Woodrose manage to hold up to the expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album can be split in half roughly. The first part consists of short and sweet songs, the first three even staying below the 3 minute mark. Very catchy
those songs show a band that knows how to strip down a song to its essentials and it only takes a single listen to remember the songs for what they are:
Bloody brilliant. Basically simple rock songs which just work because of the vocal melodies and the overall atmosphere, which is build with little things, 
be it the use of hammonds or the dual vocals in third track &lt;em&gt;Dandelion&lt;/em&gt; with such meaningful lyrics as "&lt;strong&gt;If I was a piece of gum&lt;/strong&gt; (1), 
&lt;strong&gt;I could live beneath your tongue&lt;/strong&gt;". Also present are a set of sitars which give the whole thing an eastern vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track five &lt;em&gt;Bullshit Detector&lt;/em&gt; is a turning point for the album. The vibe slows and soundwise the music opens up. The Space Rock elements overshadow
the Psychdelic parts of the album for the first time and stay dominant for the rest of the album. Trippy and gorgous this is how transcendence music
is meant to be done. &lt;em&gt;Nothing Is Real&lt;/em&gt; adds sitars to the mixture once again which rounds up the trip and is another definite song on this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the dreamy final song is over one has two options to proceed: Land back on earth or restart the journey before the effect passes away. I recommend the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Always misheard as &lt;strong&gt;cum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The God of Roosters Does Not Forget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inner Freak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cowboy Fight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double Yellow Line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you read about Mark Deutrom, the first thing you will find is his involvement in some of Melvins work
and that's most likely the base for your  expectations for this album, because Bellringer is basically
Mark Deutrom with a couple of guest musicians. So let's get this out of the way: Bellringer do not sound
like Melvins. At least not too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might get fooled when listening to first, instrumental track &lt;em&gt;The God of Roosters Does Not Forget&lt;/em&gt;, which
indeed has some kind of Melvins vibe. But second song &lt;em&gt;Quitter&lt;/em&gt; shows instantly that this album is about more than
just paying tribute to a band. I feel a strong Alice in Chains vibe with this track, including vocal harmonies
and semi-acoustic refrain. Good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inner Fight&lt;/em&gt; first indeed reminds one of Melvins' Stag album, starting off with a bass line that keeps the song moving
and some soothing vocals singing along. This is the moment one realises what a soulful voice Deutrom has to offer.
Around the 4 minute mark things suddenly change. The track opens up for a much lighter, airy sound. Flutes start play along
a jazzy fundament and carry the song to its end - quite a refreshing change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another highlight is the gloomy track &lt;em&gt;Double Yellow Line&lt;/em&gt;. Menacing in its nature without the usual heaviness, this tracks
manages to provide an intensity seldom found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album ends in a similar way, but halfway through the 7:29 track Bellringer suddenly start to become progressive again,
this time without the flutes, instead they add some distortion and and some guitar leads to make the album fade out in style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bellringer's debut full lentgth album is a short, but alltogether fun affair, which showcases a band knowing about their
roots, but not being afraid of influences from other genres. The result is a nice cocktain of Grunge, Progressive Rock and
somewhat doomy elements, which just works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmer Boys is a german Metal band that formed in 1994 and released their debut album in 1996.
The band mixed elements of Hardcore and New Wave and was considered one of the most important
Metal acts of the time, but was eventually overshadowed by the huge success of Rammstein, which
formed around the same time. Reflecting their style one has to give them credit to be far ahead
of their time, since the use of 80s sounds in Rock music became a common thing decades later.
Still Farmer Boys remain a band whose sound remains unique to this day.
Till the Cows Come Home was the second album and was released in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically Farmer Boys play a variation of Hardcore heavily inpired by Groove Metal as made famous by
bands like Machine Head or Prong. Most songs have one momoriable riff and classic chorus/verse/chorus
structure, where the verses for the most part remain in typical melodic shouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alone is good enough for most bands, because the sheer amount of fantastic riffs alone is noteworthy
and makes for a brilliant album. But things get even more interesting when the band drives into melodic
territory. Most songs hit gold with their dreamy refrains that are heavily influenced by the New Wave
sound of the eighties, including synths. Second song "When Pigs Fly" is an excellent entry point to the album since it showcases
both of the bands qualities perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title track is another standout, which focuses more on the dreamy side that made New Wave what it was.
The same thing is true for "A Dream Within a Dream" but here the band interweaves the melancholic vocal melodies
with heavy riffing once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album also features more straight forward numbers, like "Boar" or "Pain is Party". Guitar work on those tracks
is roughly comparable to Pantera, which says a lot about their ability to write standout riffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An album like this should not age very well, since it was very much a sound of a generation, but it still works
surprisingly well, most likely because the inclusion of New Wave in Rock and Metal music is not rarely seen nowadays.
If groove-driven Hardcore-influenced music is your thing and you also have a soft spot for the great Pop tunes
the Neon-Ages provided, give this one a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those last few years Noise Rock had some kind of comeback. Mostly disguised as Shoegaze
but let's not be picky here, since that is just another variant of Noise Rock. But naming
some &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; Noise release? That's definately harder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sweet Release of Death fill this gap. This album is traditional Noise Rock through and through.
The main influence is very clear: Sonic Youth. Simple drum beats, Some little guitar picks and
the somewhat dissonant voice of female vocalist Alicia Breton and here and there a melody that
sticks. And in the background seething chaos, which always finds its way to the front just to disappear
again. And suddenly the album ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us straight to the one issue this album has: The tracks almost seem like song ideas
rather than actual songs. In traditional Punk fashion most tracks stay below the 3-minute-mark,
but where Punk music usally benefits from its verse/chorus/verse structure, this album keeps its distance
from such structures. And luckily so, but the drawback to this aproach combined with the short runtime
is a feeling of many sequental ideas instead of songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this album still works as a whole is the track ordering. The tracks just flow.
Yes, it's hard to tell the end of the songs, which leaves one surprised when the album is finally done.
But it still works and makes up for a fun and pleasant listening experience simply because it's done really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the band manages to build upon their qualities while retaining their attitude and atmosphere,
I am positive that this band might become the next big thing in Noise Rock and this debut might
become a sought after gem.
Because a gem it  indeed is, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If early Sonic Youth hits your sweet spot, definately make sure to give this one a spin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended Track:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't much I could find about Tenderloud. What is known is that they started in the early 2000s and quickly built a
following thanks to intense live gigs. In 2004 they released their debut album "Shadow Red Hand" and 2007 was meant to be the
year of the follow up record, but several members leaving the band ended in some kind of hiatus instead. "Gospel Ticket" finally
saw the light of day in 2012 as an digital exclusive album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album starts with "1965" and instantly sets the tone for the overall sound. This seems to be a Country album. Americana to be
more precise, the darker brother of your usual Country. But something is different here. The drums start playing and wow, these are
some dynamic sounding drums. Nice to hear some sane produced album. The vocals do remind of David Eugene Edwards, almighty vocalist
of 16 Horsepower and Wovenhand, the first being &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; band most people associate with the so-called Alternative-Country scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenderloud fall into the same category but there is a small but important detail that makes a huge difference. The band has two hearts
beating, the mellow, Roots-driven and the crunchy guitar lovin' one. In their louder moments Tenderloud resemble The Gun Club in some
moments and early 90s Seattle sound in others. The whole mixture works to their benefit and soundwise this is as good as it can get...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...which wouldn't be worth much if the songs don't work. Luckily Tenderloud seem to have it all. A dynamic mastering with just the right
tone for each instrument, a healthy mixture of musical styles, a good vocalist and yes, a talented songwriter to bring it all together.
Just listen to second track "Pass Me By", the first highlight of the album. It has a banjo melody that instantly sticks 
and a refrain that just kicks. And this is only the start. Follow up "Liquor Eyes" has a Polka vibe to it without losing any of the 
bands controlling nature to keep the song in its well defined barriers. 
The album keeps on with standout after standout, "Happy Days", "White Lines" and "45 Mile Man" are single-worthy and personal favorite "Horses of the Woods"
could have been included on the "Singles Soundtrack" easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band manages to keep up that momentum until the very end.
Tenderloud may be quite an unknown band, but they surely created something outstanding here which I consider to be one of the very best
albums of the whole Alternative Country movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended tracks: "Horses of the Woods", "45 Mile Man", "White Lines", "Happy Days"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable mixture of Post-Metal and Black Metal which results in a trippy and very emotional joyride. Very captivating album from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=649311395/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://oathbreakerband.bandcamp.com/album/rheia"&gt;Rheia by Oathbreaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Take Over and Destroy - Take Over and Destroy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-Punk at its core but dressed as a Metal band, this is Take Over and Destroy. Closest comparison is probably Sentenced in their prime time, but
Take Over and Destroy are  much more energetic and the obvious Post-Punk influences are presented with pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=875529036/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://takeoveranddestroy.bandcamp.com/album/take-over-and-destroy"&gt;Take Over And Destroy by Take Over And Destroy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ladyhawke - Wild Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best Pop releases of the year and I didn't even notice it. While Ladyhawke was always one of the good ones of the genre, "Wild Things"
might be her best offering yet. More polished, more diverse and just a fun record, which is all one should expect from a Pop album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3929357638/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://polyvinylrecords.bandcamp.com/album/ladyhawke-wild-things"&gt;Ladyhawke - Wild Things by Polyvinyl Records&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sylvaine - Wistful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvaines "Wistful" came out early in the year and noone could yet predict Alcest returning to their roots a few months later.
Sylvaine basically filled the hole Alcest left open when they decided to go all Shoegaze on us and she delivered. While she
doesn't always succeed in providing the really big vocal melodies the album strikes with its atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3449595750/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://sylvainemusic.bandcamp.com/album/wistful"&gt;Wistful by Sylvaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Shura - Nothing's Real&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another little Pop gem, which wasn't to be expected after her EP released last year. This album on the other hand is pure fun with styles
ranging from early Madonna inspired New Wave to a more modern aproach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJ4uBdmnKds" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Elephant Tree - Elephant Tree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doom Metal meets Psychedelic/Stoner meets Grunge. Not a rare combination of genres, but Elephant Tree prove to be capable of writing great
songs that work even though most of them are relatively long. The vocal harmonies are some of the best Alice in Chains alike I have heard in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4154098583/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://elephanttreeband.bandcamp.com/album/elephant-tree"&gt;Elephant Tree by Elephant Tree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lotus Thief - Gramarye&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me combine a few quotes from their bandcamp page: "Text Metal band 'Lotus Thief' feautures members of Green Metal band 'The Botanist'"
I don't know who comes up with these genre names, but personally I find those hilarious. Anyway, what DO Lotus Thief sound like after all?
Well, hints of Post Metal, hints of Black Metal, with a healthy dose of Ambient and Doom and with the album opener they easily created one of the best songs in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=514864084/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://lotusthief.bandcamp.com/album/gramarye"&gt;Gramarye by Lotus Thief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sinistro - Semente&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to say about this album. It's Doom Metal with female voices done right. &lt;em&gt;Really&lt;/em&gt; right, her voice is out of this world and the songs are
just so bloody good it might get close to Year of the Cobras album with a few more listens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2650049396/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://projectosinistro.bandcamp.com/album/semente"&gt;Semente by Sinistro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Swarm of the Sun - The Rifts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great Post-Metal album which is more on the atmospheric side than on the Metal one. Very captivating from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=676580524/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://aswarmofthesun.bandcamp.com/album/the-rifts"&gt;The Rifts by A Swarm of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Moonsorrow - Jumalten Aika&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am not a huge fan of their past work, Jumalten Aika simply clicked. It's the production of the album and the melancholic
feel of the whole album that simply hit my sweet spot. What you get: Pagan Metal, delivered in overly long and epic tracks that couldn't be further
away from the usual crap this genre usally provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="400px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/btI0AiJAC70" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trees of Eternity - Trees of Eternity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admitted, Trees of Eternity play regular Gothic Metal, but the mixture of a well rounded production, a nice female vocalist (who sadly passed away this year)
and all in all great songs just have that special something. Yes, the album is not diverse which holds it back a bit, but it's still a very satisfying
listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1709381829/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://treesofeternity.bandcamp.com/album/hour-of-the-nightingale"&gt;Hour of the Nightingale by Trees of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Aurora - All My Demons Greeting Me As a Friend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop again. 2016 was my personal Metal year, but at the same time lots of Pop albums were insanely good and this one is one of them.
Somewhere between Singer/Songwriter and Electronic Pop Aurora just has that special something to make this style of music enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="400px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTwdGRHl5Mw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hail Spirit Noir - Mayhem in Blue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And something special for the end. Hail Spirit Noir are a Progressive Black Metal/Rock band from Greece and with this new album they
emphasise the Progressive Rock elements of their music even more resulting in their most accessible album yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2695943380/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://hailspiritnoir.bandcamp.com/album/mayhem-in-blue"&gt;Mayhem in Blue by Hail Spirit Noir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Reticent - On the Eve of a Goodbye&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older Opeth take #1. This one is pretty much brand new for me but I can already tell this is one of the highlights in the genre of
Progressive Death Metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3685290810/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://heavenandhellrecords.bandcamp.com/album/on-the-eve-of-a-goodbye"&gt;On the Eve of a Goodbye by THE RETICENT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perihelion Ship - A Rare Thunderstorm in Spring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older Opeth take #2. Not an album I missed, but I simply forgot to add it to original list. What Perihelion Ship celebrate on their debut album is just breathtaking. Clearly Opeth influenced the band manages to
create an album that is demanding, melodic, heavy and just alltogether brilliant. Hopefully not their last one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2207519023/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless&gt;&lt;a href="http://perihelionship.bandcamp.com/album/a-rare-thunderstorm-in-spring"&gt;A Rare Thunderstorm in Spring by Perihelion Ship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prong - X-No Absolutes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How embarassing. I was so convinced that this album came out in 2015 which led to it being excluded from toplist alltogether. Too bad, because this is
another stunning work from Prong. Building on top of what made "Ruining Lives" so good and add even more hooks to it even more Thrash and even more
heaviness. Accessible as f*** but at the same time in your face to the max. Simply a fun Metal album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VkZNftcIYrw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Slothrust - Everyone Else&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A band that went totally under my radar. Luckily not any longer, because the low-fi Alternative Rock with some crunching moments
and a charming vocalist with witty lyrics are just too good to be missed. Somewhere between Courtney Barnett and Sonic Youth
Slothrust should be on anyones list who can appreciate 90s Alternative music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh bandcamp. What are you doing to me. Or rather my little purse.
In one of many lonely nights I was browsing you again and you decided to introduce me to a whole
lot of Stoner/Psychedelic bands (again). Many, many, awesome albums found their way into
my collection. But there was one album in particular that was... different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't much I found out about the band. They are from France and released a Demo before undergoing
quite some lineup changes, which also meant a change in sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that sound is special on "Into the Fog...". Let's start with the production, because it's striking on first
listen. It has this uniqueness not often found on albums anymore. The guitars are crisp, not fully distorted.
Details in sound were more important than heavy riffs, when making this record. The drums have quite some
oldschool Dave Jerden (Alice in Chains' Dirt) feeling, reverb is key here. And finally the vocalist.
Aggressive, but melodic at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Alice in Chains' Dirt album. This is probably the closest of a comparison one can make for "Into the Fog".
And not in the usual "Let's do some vocal harmonies" kind of way. Stonebirds manage to capture the same kind of depressive atmosphere of that classic album, while maintaining their very own style, which mainly consists of Sludge, tiny pieces of Stoner Rock and just the right amount of hooks. Just listen to 3rd track "Angst Lover". A definite highlight and one of the best songs 2015 had to offer. This is classic stuff per excellence and should be appealing to most that loved the nineties, but also the open minded Neurosis fans. And everyone in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title track is another highlight of the album. It combines all the elements mentioned until it hits the 3 minute mark and suddenly transforms into this hell of a riff monster, which actually reminded me of a certain "Dopes to Infinity" album. Listen and you will understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one negative thing to be said about Stonebirds' latest album, it's the time. 5 songs, making a total of 34 minutes is just too short. But those are probably the best 34 minutes you will have all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariana Grande is one of those Disney kids that started to sing on TV when
they were still children. Normally they start playing some role in a
disgusting TV series and at some point start a solo career as a singer,
where they soon leave behind their Teenager image and become sluts that
sing about nothing but sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariana is no exception here, though she hasn't reached the slut state yet.
At least not totally, there is one song on this album which might give a hint
where things will move on her next album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound wise Ariana was and is always compared with Mariah Carey. A comparison
that lacks substance, because while Ariana has an impressive and unique voice,
just like Mariah has, the overall sound is very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On her debut album, Ariana played hugely 90s inspired pop music.
Album number 2 sounds different. It's modern, best to be heard on the track
"Break Free" which is an EDM song featuring Zedd. If you hate this genre, don't listen
to this song, because you will not be able to get it out of your head.
The other single of the album is "Problem" another song, one might find annoying after a
while, but it's definately an ear catcher.
Those two songs, together with "Bang Bang" are obvious single releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the album has more to offer. Right between those singles "One Last Time" and "Why Try"
are placed, bringing a more conventional sound. And Ariana delivers. This is the
stuff classic pop songs are made of.
"Love me harder", feat. The Weekend  goes into a similar direction, fantastic hook, one for
the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course being compared to Mariah Carey brings the need for huge ballads. And indeed the album
has some great moments to offer. "Best Mistake" is a great example for a good ballad, if it weren't
for the male rapper, that seems to be essential for any pop album nowadays. Too bad, Ariana would
sound much better on her own.
"Just a little bit of your heart" is the second big moment on the record. An easy song,
but with huge effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't a single really bad track on this album, but one that has to be mentioned on its own.
"Hands on me" is what sadly has to be expected from every Disney-grown female artist at some point
in her career. Yes, it's a slut song. And no, she shouldn't do it, it doesn't suit her. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, "My Everything" does most things right and if there is one thing one has to critizise, it's
the fact that there are too many features on this album. Ariana is one, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; biggest voice
in pop music right now, she does not need support by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wish I could go back to the nineties just to crawl in old record stores again.
With my knowledge of music nowadays there are surely some gems I haven't bothered checking out
back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystery Machine is one of those bands. They haven't even been unsuccesful. In Canada their first
two albums sold quite good and they even were nominated for the Much Music Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystery Machine released 3 albums back in the days and then went on hiatus just to return in 2012
to release another album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Speed was their second effort and together with their debut "Graced" marked their peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soundwise Mystery Machine are a child of their times. The influences are obvious. Grunge, Noise Rock,
Shoegaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Mystery Machine sets apart from many bands is their potential to find the right balance between
edgy and accessible, distorted rockers and half acoustic hymns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band also shows, why todays alternative rock is in large parts so bloody boring in comparison.
Where todays bands rely on riffing only, bands back then played lots of little leads, clean or noisy.
This keeps a song from sounding mundayne, instead something new awaits the listener after each segment.
This is what makes great albums, there is actually something to discover and it's too much to grasp it all
on first listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that last statement made you think about Dinosaur Jr. then you got the first obvious comparison just
right. J. Mascis' band surely was an influence for this band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really isn't anything wrong with this album. Slower tunes such as "Sinker" with its great guitar final
go hand in hand with straight out rockers like the brilliant opener "Pound for Pound".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly the band members consider themselves as a shoegaze band. Personally I am missing the obvious
trademark sounds from this genre and rather see Mystery Machine as a Noise Rock band. In the end it doesn't
matter, both genres are closely related and as long as the result is of such high quality as in this case,
who am I to complain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while a flashback like this shows what has been missing from the majority of music in recent times,
luckily there have been a few bands rediscovering these sounds, like Dead Confederate or
Cheatahs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystery Machine on the other hand are one of the originals. It just happens that some never heard of them.
Even more glad I am now, that I had the chance of discovering these guys 20 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelly Furtado is a canadian singer who most likely does not need an introduction.
She sold 40 million records to date and had numerious top charting songs by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My introduction to Nelly was this very album back in 2003. I didn't think it was bad
but it also never stroke me as particulary good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well last year I gave it another try and it clicked. Not only is it enjoyable, it is
actually a special album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us straight to the sound of the album. Because "Folklore" indeed sounds different
to your regular Pop album. A lot of acoustic guitars and percussive rhythms lead your through
the total  time of roughly 50 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First song "One Trick Pony" with its banjo background instantly shows off with its folk elements,
which continues in track 2, which was my first introduction to the album. This one actually sounds
a little bit like Alanis Morissette - and again, banjo sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Explode" has kind of an electro-pop vibe to it, long before this kind of genre established itself.
Its instantly followed by "Try" - one of the singles from this album. And it was a single for a reason
A sweet acoustic-guitar driven song, with a refrain one cannot resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this way the album continues. More electronic songs follow the more folky ones until the album hits
its peak with "Picture Perfect". This song is in a league of its own. This song has it all. Great drums,
a nice guitar lead and an overall fantastic atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Grass is Green" sounds like Sia, long before she was even known to anyone and after the album
played through you realise: This is pretty good. It's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly Nelly changed style on her next album and never was able to return to this quality again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about music is that once in a while you will be surprised. Lately I had quite a lot of these moments
and Flower is responsible for one such occasion. Browsing some 90s related blog site I listened through some of
the mentioned bands and the first seconds of Flower made it clear to me: This might be one of those albums.
After all these years that feeling has become somewhat reliable and it turns out Flower is indeed a band that
produced 2 classic albums. Far away from the eyes of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concrete Sky is a compilation album, which features both of Flowers' full length albums on a single disc, released
by Simple Machines in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it I am raving about? Classic Noise Rock. If Sonic Youth during their Daydream Nation period is something
that appeals to you, believe me, this will too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flower's albums both sounded simliar, but still there was some noticable differences between the two.
The first nine tracks of the compilation was originally released as "Concrete".
The songs are mostly straight forward indie rock, very momoriable with good production and
if you need a comparison, it's probably Pixies and The Wedding present that need to be mentioned.
But yes, Sonic Youth lurk around the corner, which can be prominently heard on track 3 "Hologram Sky" or track 5 "Memorial Day".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From track 10 on their original "Hologram Sky" fills the rest of the disc. Production is tighter than on their debut album,
guitars are punchier and with "Ohio" you will find the first real actual hit. Well, if the world was a fair place to be, at least.
The bass is also more prominent than on Flowers' first outing. the vocals are more argessive, I dare say it: This has a grungy sound to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then comes the revelation. From "Magick" onwards this might well be a Daydream Nation tribute album. And I mean this in the best possible way.
It's no rip-off, but songwriting and style are very similar to that classic Noise album.
Edgy, playful, and you will find yourself not being able to get those tunes out of your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What remains? Well, Concrete Sky is a &lt;em&gt;must have&lt;/em&gt; for any Noise Rock fan. It's that easy and I consider their albums total classics already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Girls aloud are manufactured bubblegum pop - but they are awesome"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember very well reading this on some youtube video. And I couldn't
agree more.
Yes, they didn't write any of their songs (In fact every one of them was
written by songwriter ensemble Xenomania).
Yes, they emerged from a reality-TV show and most likely were chosen purely
by looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is there to like?&lt;br&gt;
Quite a lot actually...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all Xenomania were consistent with their musical direction. While
Girls Aloud definately was a pop group, they always had these odd influences
noone expects from such an act. Quite a lot of their songs are straight out
rockers and breathe a healthy dose of punk rock in the best possible way.
This reminds the listener of the Go-Go's, whose main singer should be well known:
Belinda Carlisle.&lt;br&gt;
While none of the girls had a charisma half as big as Ms. Carlisle, the group
as a whole managed to appear ironic, fun to be with and sometimes even a tiny bit
critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Punk. There I said it.&lt;br&gt;
No Girls Aloud were no punk, but they delivered some kind of attitude, which
combined with the witty, fun lyrics completed an image of actual rock chicks.&lt;br&gt;
The album starts off with "Models", an eccentric track with this typical
Xenomania vibe. Its basically a very modern version of the 80s, but without the
bombast. More Post-Punk than New Wave. Without the punk of course.&lt;br&gt;
It's followed by a song that might very well be the best pop song of the whole
new millenium thus far. Classic Blues-Rock lead, and a refreain thats just one
thing: fun. Nothing deep, no experiements, but fun and that's all one could ask
for from a good pop song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the album continues in a similar fashion. Upbeat, rock-influenced
tunes, with catchy melodies (Watch Me Go), 60s influenced
rock song (Waiting), even somewhat experimental songs (Swinging London Town).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course a proper girl-band needs some ballads too. And Xenomania delivered here,
too. "Wild Horses" and "Whole Lotta History" are well executed and you might
catch yourself humming along those melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's the verdict here? Chemistry is a very entertaining record that doesn't get
boring at all. While the girls had funnier (and even critical) lyrics on later
albums, the overall quality of this one was never matched again. At least if you
come from a proper rock background, like I do. Chemistry was their most rocking
effort, but honestly: Every album was quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not close-minded and the obvious manufacturing aspect doesn't put you
off, give this album a try, it's in all seriousness a great listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siobhán Donaghy is best known, because she founded the Sugababes together with
Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan. They only released one album in that particular
setup. After that Siobhán left the band and soon started her solo career.
She released one album (Revolution in Me) which had a few minor hits.
In 2007 she returned with "Ghosts" and while an absolute critics favorite
it only sold around 3000 units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3000 sold discs. That's an awful low for an artist that once was part of one
of the most successful girlbands around. It's even worse considering how much
effort she put into this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it about this album that makes it that special? Well for a start:
it's quirky. Maybe Siobhán was on drugs, which we all know is the best thing
one can do when recording music.
The whole album feels out-of-place, airy, ghostly. This is espacially true
for the title track, with its backward recorded vocals. That fact in itself is
already worth mentioning, but the song sounds totally accessible at the same
time. It's one of those songs others would kill for. If you don't care for this
album, get it for this track alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean that the rest of the album falls short. While sounding a bit
more traditional (but still keeping this strange, odd atmosphere), every single
song simply is a little gem of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with "Don't Give It Up", a song with a huge Kate Bush feel
to it. Trippy drums and layered vocals, in combination with this floating keyboard
floor, give a hint, what kind of journey the listener is about to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So You Say" was released as a single, a good choice, the refrain won't let go
off you for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album, while twisted, has an overall happy feeling to it, but it's the kind
of self-reflected happiness that doesn't try to force itself onto others.
It sounds satisfied, like someone who is in peace with oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be it the Massive Attack influenced "Halcyion Days" or the Ray-of-Light-like
"Goldfish", the once-again-kate-bush-influenced "Medevac" or the acoustic-guitar-driven
"12 Bar Acid Blues", Donaghy makes sure the listener is pleased through out
the whole album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was not rewarded. 3000 sold units are not enough for an artist who
wants to live from the music. And because she was pretty sure she wouldn't be
able to top this album, she went on musical hiatus. Too bad, but she was probably
right about that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a minor flaw with this album: Once again itunes stepped in and reserved
an exclusive bonus track, which you cannot find legally anymore.
"Man on a Mission" is well worth owning, but sadly one is forced to rip it off
of youtube. And while we are at it: There are quite some B-sides on the singles
from this album. Every one of them is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not quite as great as this album though, which is a definite 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saint Saviour, or Becky Jones, received a bigger audience after 2009, when she
was the lead singer for Groove Armada. Around the same time she started her
solo careeer, releasing 2 EPs and her first album in 2012.
On that album many compared her to Kate Bush, which was relatively justified.
"Union" was a partly rocking, partly electronic album with quite some epic hymns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Becky released her second album. "In the Seams" it's called and I expected
another Kate Bush influenced album. My expectations were totally wrong.
When I first skipped through the album it seemed to be a real lackluster.
Gone are the guitars, gone are the drums. It's only about her this time.
Vocals with some piano tones and a bit of violins (played by  Manchester Camerata Orchestra -
another former band of Becky).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't make the same mistake I did. Don't skip through the album hastily. Give it
a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; listen. Dim the lights, turn up the volume and sink in.
And suddenly you realise: This is a thing of beauty. And it even has a clear
comparison: If you liked last year's Agnes Obel album, you most likely will love
this one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saint Saviour knows how to create lovely melodies. Some of them will surely stick
with you for days. Take the wonderful "Let It Go". A simple 2-tone piano and then
her voice kicks in, building an image, a scenery of autumn, most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it short: If melancholy, sophisticated pop music is your thing, get this.
But take your time with this one, its not background music.
Not because it's challenging, it rather wants to be found and then demands your
full attention.
In some louder moments (like in the mentioned Let It Go) even Sophie Hunger
might be a valid comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gosh, I very remember, when Christina Aguilera hit the scene.
Her huge hit "Genie in a bottle" was inescapable and boy, I hated it with a passion.
The music was the typical pop of the times and Ms. Aguilera herself also didnt strike
me as very attractive (as if that matters).
The following years I was without a TV so whatever happened to her and her music
didn't reach me.
Well apart from "Beautiful" from this very album, which I always liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't even tell when or why, but Spotify recommended this album to me and since this was
a time I opened up to some Pop I gave it a try - and was pleasantly surprised.
Normally this kind of music needs a lot of listens for me, simply because it's not my
cup of tea. But "Stripped" immediately captured my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one unbelievably bad song on this record and it was even released as the first single ("Dirrty").
The song and the video are so crap and cheap critics smashed it for good reasons.
The collaboration with Redman did the rest for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the actual album sounds nothing like that song. There are two more features here:
Lil Kim raps on "Can't Hold Us Down" (I could have done with this part) and Alicia
Keys plays piano on her self-written song "Impossible". (Which is a definite highlight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no clearly defined sound on this album. The album starts off with the mentioned
Lil Kim feature, which shines with its slight influences from the rap culture.
It is followed by "Walk Away" which is a breathtaking song. It's a ballad, that is
driven by a rather simple piano hook and a rather jazzy tone. Ballads, as it turns out
are what Christina does best. This one is one for the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is followed by a rather surprising song. "Fighter". Surprising because it's a pure Rock Song.
Relatively heavy guitars create the base for this satisfying song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genre roundabout goes on and the next songs go from flamenco ("Infatuation") over pure urban
("Loving Me 4 Me") to "Impossible" which I mentioned above. It's no big surprise that
this one sounds like an Alicia Keys song and that in itself makes it a gem. But
Aguilera makes one thing clear: She can sing. Really sing. It's such a joy to hear her
create melodies, changing from soft to rough voice and back again. On later albums
(and especially live) she overdid the singing. Here it's just spot-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlights and genres don't stop here. "Underappreciated" is a funk song full of hooks
and is followed by the best-known song of this album. "Beautiful" is just that.
Even the Lemonheads were captured by this song and covered it on one of their albums.
A modern evergreen and nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's followed by the indie-rock hymn "Make Over" and two Soul songs, all plain brilliant.
"Soar" builds up intensely building up to an impressive choir-driven ascendo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the disgusting "Dirrty" the album ends with three highlights.
"A Voice within" is a pop-ballad in the veins of Mariah Carey and it's possibly one of the
best ballads ever written. (By the way, you've got to watch the video for this one, she
looks stunning)
I'm OK is another acoustic guitar driven ballad and another highlight, before the album ends
with the last number. Another Soul song, which again builds up nicely and leaves the listener
very satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all: The lyrics on this album are partly sultry, but never dumb (with the mentioned exception).
Most times they are even serious, trying to take a shot on society issues.
While Aguilera will never be an activist, it's a brave step to even try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway - if you have just the slightest open spot for good pop music, get this one.
If it weren't for the one song, I'd call this a perfect album.
But since this leaves 15 great to brilliant songs (three songs are interludes/intros) I can't help but
to give this one a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cult of Luna. This band has been around since the early 2000s. Rising from the
ashes of Hardcore band Umeå, they played slow and aggressive doom metal, which
incorperated more and more elements of Post-Rock into their sound.
Nowadays they are seen as one of the leaders of the whole Post-Metal scene.
Vertikal is their sixth album to date and it's probably their most accessible one, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me admit it. "Vertikal" is my first Cult of Luna album.
Let me also get this straight. It's good. It's so good that I got their
back catalogue as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one should characterize Cult of Luna's Sound, "aggressive"
and maybe "disturbing" will most likely be words you hear.
And initially I would agree. The guitars have a somewhat dirty sound, the overall
tempo is sluggish and the vocals consist of roars rather than singing.
But something else is there. It's not instantly recognizable, while the first song
is playing. In fact it's not evident until the second song "Vicarious Redemption"
hits the eleven minute mark. That's the moment when you suddenly hear a hint of dubstep
which is soon replaced by a lead guitar line that sticks with you instantly.
This line is accompanied by a building up of sounds - several layers of guitars, some keyboards
and then... the harmonies end again.
But this moment marks the first point one can relate to, if new to this kind of sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next instant moment is probably the song "In Awe of".
Here the situation is different though. While not really different from the rest of
the material, this one is an instant ear-catcher. The keyboards creating the base
for the haunting atmosphere, again accompanied by aggressive vocals. But it seems
more strucutred than previous songs. And what is this? A vocal melody around the 4 minute mark.
The only one on the whole record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you managed to cope with the pressing nature of this record, you will soon come back
for another round. And start to notice all those small melodies hidden in the
layered guitars. You begin to realise that those riffs are quite catchy and
that the missing verse-chorus-verse structure is actually what makes this kind of music
interesting. Welcome to world of Post-Metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sets Cult of Luna apart from others of their kind?
They can write interesting song strucutres for a start. At least three songs on this
record are outstanding (I: The Weapon, Vacarious Redemption, In Awe of), the rest is still
pretty damn good.
For me this was the best Post-Rock/Metal release of 2013, right behind
Russian Circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I should start listening to their older records...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jewel released Pieces of You in 1995 she became everyone's darling
with her Singer/Songwriter songs that seemed too authentic to be fake.
And indeed, there was much of Jewel herself in those songs. Being homeless for
quite a while and singing in cheap pubs to earn a few cents, while not having
any contact with her family - that was Jewel's life back then. That street
credibility made her real. She refused a big check for her record deal and tried
to be herself.
Success came quickly - to everyone's surprise in a time when the endtimes of Grunge
and the rising of Britpop dominated the music scene. Infact Jewel became so
succesful that the big Bob Dylan asked her to go on tour with him.
As the story goes Bob has told her to remain exactly the way she was. "Don't
play their game - be yourself" Jewel quoted him on a Howard Stern interview.
She did not listen to him and on her second album "Sprit" one could hear quite
some Pop/Rock influences. Did that hurt her music? Not yet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, quite the contrary. While "Pieces of You" might have been Jewel's most
(and probably only) personal record, "Spirit" earns a lot from some of the best
Songwriting the 90s had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all this is an album in the vein of Sarah McLachlan, maybe a bit more quiet
at most times. But where Sarah made pure Rock/Pop in her greatest days, there is
something on this album that is different. An essence of the record reaches out
and tries to remind you why this album is indeed special.
The irony: While being far more commercial than its predecessor this album is
once again influenced by a dying music scene, by incorperating elements of the Seattle
style.&lt;br /&gt;
No, this is not a Rock album, but the overall mood and the
guitar playing always make me picture images of "&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105415"&gt;Singles&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her style of singing hasn't changed from the debut album, but all seems more polished
and tighter produced. Some called it overproduced, but I don't agree, the production
of this album fits the music just perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's recap. Melancholy songs driven by some of the nicest guitar picking with
a voice that can actually sing. But what about the songs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album could be categorized into two parts: Radio friendly songs, Rock songs, if you like
and those down-to-the-minum songs that made her debut great already.
"Deep Water", "Hands", "Down So Long" fall into the first category and the last two
had been released as singles - "Hands" being one of her most prominent songs.
By the way, the video for "Down So Long" proves the Seattle influence being
a very typical video for that particular time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the album is compiled from those other songs, the quiet ones that you
overhear easily on first listen.
"Kiss the Flame" is a prime example for such a song. Nothing special going on.
A very minimal acoustic guitar is played to some ambient Keyboard floor.
And Ms. Kilcher sings. Then suddenly she forms a melody with nothing more than those
three words that define the title. And once this new creation finds the listener, it
won't be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's in a nutshell, what describes this album best: Small gems hidden in small
melodies and guitar licks. It never sounds special. But it is, once those gems
have found a place in your memory. Which they will. Not on first listen. Maybe not
on second either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we all know the best albums are not those sticking from the start, but
those that need to be worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Spirit" needed a few years for me and from then on it never left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from the moment it arrived it was clear, this is one for the island,
a close friend that deserves to have a spot in my personal list of classics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do Peter Mengede, Tom Capone and Pete Hines have in common, apart from the
fact that you probably don't know their names?
Well for one, they all played in bands, you most likely DO know, if hardcore is
something you can relate to.
Let's drop the names: Helmet, Cro-Mags, Quicksand, Murphy's Law. Sounds familar?
It should. If not, there is some catch-up to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing with rock-supergroups is, that they are normally quite boring.
Not brave enough to do their own thing, not creative enough to step out of their
main bands' shadow. It's a mix of individuals that haven't played before and that
reflects in the songs. Normally, because Handsome were different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not different in the sense that they sounded unlike anything else they did before.
But they sure were different, quality-wise.
Let's start by answering the obvious. Is this a hardcore album? To answer this
let's take a quick look at their past bands.
There is Helmet, always labeled Hardcore, but in reality they were a Noiserock
band with a tendency to heavy riffing.
Then there is Cro-Mags, a band noone ever was able to clearly categorize as either
Metal or Hardcore.
Quicksand is probably the closest to a Hardcore band, but even they were... different.
If you really need to compare Handsome with its members former bands, it mostly sounds
like a mixture of Helmet-like riffing, paired with Quicksands way of creating
melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production on this thing is very tight. Sharp drums, Noisy, but clear and heavy
guitars, create the sound fundament for this 46 minute trip.
Most songs have somewhat epic refrains, which makes it easy to remember them.
"Needles", "Thrown Away" or "Dim the Lights" are obvious hits and it really makes you
wonder, why this band never took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one weak spot in Handsomes sound, it's the vocals. Jeremy Chatelain has
kind of a weak voice, spot on with the melodies, but lacking in charisma.
But this is easily compensated by the quality of the song material on this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are into hardcore bands like the ones mentioned, I highly recommend to listen
to this thing. I give it a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and consider this a personal classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite ironic. Most people have probably not heard a song sung by Sia in their lifetime.
And even if, it was most likely some guest vocals for another artist.
Yet, I bet around everyone has heard at least one Sia song.
She is responsible for a ***load of huge hits from the last decade.
Beyoncé, Rihanna, Rita Ora, Kate Perry. Is there anyone that doesn't know these names? Well rest assured, Sia has written at least some of their hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she also has an impressive back catalog of albums, which span from Singer/Songwriter
over Rock to pure Pop. And it's all very convincing.
Maybe this is the reason why the booklet never shows Sia's face.
It's always just an empty spot. People have heard her songs, but they connect it to another person.
Can this album change this fact? Probably not, Does it have the potential to do so? Definately yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Sound&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first notes of Chandelier, the first single, open the album and if you know her older albums
you have to wonder: Is this really Sia? The opening sounds just like Rihanna. Both her voice and the style of urban rhythms are quite similar. Not the best sign.
Then after a short bridge, the refrain kicks in. And boy, what a hymn. It's that kind of song that leaves you speechless.
Her voice also sounds much better in the refrain, reaching for the high tones easily, but never getting weak.
The scheme repeats for a few times and this pop masterpiece is over. And that's when you think, the album can only go down from here. And it does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second song "Big Girls Cry" hits a similar tone, not quite as much pathos,
but still a very catchy refrain. Sia shows off her songwriting skills. Hearing these melodies you don't wonder for one moment, about her success as a ghost-writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use this moment to try to catch the essence of the sound on this album.
Close your eyes. Picture yourself in a hall full of people. The air is cool and music is playing. loud.
Its that kind of loudness that leaves echoes of the playing song. Reverb and bass are the key here - combined with a vocal delivery that seems to flow above everything else.
If this sounds retro to you, yes - this album captures the spirit of the 80s.
There always seems to be an echo of Sia's voice floating in the air. The drums keep vibrating.
Yet, this is not a retro album. Quite the contrary - this is a very modern release,
which is inspired by a specific era. And it just happens to be the one most prominent for its huge melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the same vein the tracks continue to flow until "Hostage", the 5th track gives us a break.
That's Sia we knew from her last record, the one doing rock songs with an attitude.
Still very catchy, but somewhat edgy. After 4 pop-hymns in a row "Hostage" takes the perfect slot on the album to relax the listener. Well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album goes straight back to the beginning. Pop songs, with a dark twist to it.
Very modern, but yet very reminiscent of the past. And it ends with the darkest song of the album and
yet another climax, before suddenly ending the journey with 6 simple piano notes going down. We are not flowing anymore, feet on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what remains in the end? 1000 Forms of Fear is a flawless pop record.
There is one thing that remains to be seen though. Records like this tend to age quickly.
We will see how well this album survives the test of time. But for now I give it a well deserved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know that feeling, when you listen to an artist and think you should
have known that artist earlier?
Charlotte Martin is one of those artists for me.
I first discovered her late 2012 and was instantly blown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading on the web I found out she is married to Ken Andrews, who on his behalf
fronts the alternative rock band "Failure", another great band i learned to love
far too late.
I also found out that she was often compared to Tori Amos, another great performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track that introduced me to Charlotte back then was "Limits of Our Love" from this very album.
This song has a definite Kate Bush feeling to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at this point I had 3 connection points to her music. Kate Bush, Failure and
Tori Amos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Your shore starts off with the title song and a strong piano hook, which as it
turns out, is a trademark of her music.
The style of piano playing is remarkable. Mentioned easy hooks get you, well - hooked,
while there is happening quite a lot in the lower registers.
After a few minutes the drums kick in and layered vocals make up the refrain.
There you have the typical Charlotte Martin song-formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounded negative, be assured, it isn't. The fact she found her typical
style of song, does - by no means - conclude her writing the same song over and over again.
No, quite the oposite, her predictive way of writing songs results in equally high
quality to all her outputs so far. And especially this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's with the influences? Tori Amos is, of course, an obvious comparison.
Piano, drums, no fear of using the lower half of her instrument. Yes, there are
a lot of similarities here.
But where Tori tends to sound weird at times Charlotte always captures the
right amount of Pop-appeal. Is it pop though?
Stand-out track "Limits of Our Love" begs to differ. Triple drumming and
a rather dark atmosphere make this more a goth-hymn than your typical pop song.
Without the clichees, that is. And I said it before. This could be a Kate Bush
song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves the 3rd connection, Failure. Well, rest assured, Charlotte Marting is
not a rock artist. But her sound shows a lot of love for this genre.
The song "Steel" finishes with a piano/guitar final, that leaves nothing to be desired.
I am sure I would have enjoyed this even in my louder youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing has to be pointed out though: Charlotte Martin is definately not a copy cat.
Yes, there are similarities, but she mixes those to her own musical cocktail
in such a captivating way, that I can only conclude with my final statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On a Shore" is a classic in every way. If you have missed it, use this day,
which marks it's 10 year anniversary. And once you fell in love with it,
dive into the rest of her discography, which is of equal quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10&lt;/p&gt;
