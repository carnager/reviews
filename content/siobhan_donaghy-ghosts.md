### Introduction
Siobhán Donaghy is best known, because she founded the Sugababes together with
Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan. They only released one album in that particular
setup. After that Siobhán left the band and soon started her solo career.
She released one album (Revolution in Me) which had a few minor hits.
In 2007 she returned with "Ghosts" and while an absolute critics favorite
it only sold around 3000 units.

### The Sound
3000 sold discs. That's an awful low for an artist that once was part of one
of the most successful girlbands around. It's even worse considering how much
effort she put into this release.

So what is it about this album that makes it that special? Well for a start:
it's quirky. Maybe Siobhán was on drugs, which we all know is the best thing
one can do when recording music.
The whole album feels out-of-place, airy, ghostly. This is espacially true
for the title track, with its backward recorded vocals. That fact in itself is
already worth mentioning, but the song sounds totally accessible at the same
time. It's one of those songs others would kill for. If you don't care for this
album, get it for this track alone.

That doesn't mean that the rest of the album falls short. While sounding a bit
more traditional (but still keeping this strange, odd atmosphere), every single
song simply is a little gem of its own.

The album kicks off with "Don't Give It Up", a song with a huge Kate Bush feel
to it. Trippy drums and layered vocals, in combination with this floating keyboard
floor, give a hint, what kind of journey the listener is about to experience.

"So You Say" was released as a single, a good choice, the refrain won't let go
off you for a few days.

The album, while twisted, has an overall happy feeling to it, but it's the kind
of self-reflected happiness that doesn't try to force itself onto others.
It sounds satisfied, like someone who is in peace with oneself.

Be it the Massive Attack influenced "Halcyion Days" or the Ray-of-Light-like
"Goldfish", the once-again-kate-bush-influenced "Medevac" or the acoustic-guitar-driven
"12 Bar Acid Blues", Donaghy makes sure the listener is pleased through out
the whole album.

But it was not rewarded. 3000 sold units are not enough for an artist who
wants to live from the music. And because she was pretty sure she wouldn't be
able to top this album, she went on musical hiatus. Too bad, but she was probably
right about that statement.

There is a minor flaw with this album: Once again itunes stepped in and reserved
an exclusive bonus track, which you cannot find legally anymore.
"Man on a Mission" is well worth owning, but sadly one is forced to rip it off
of youtube. And while we are at it: There are quite some B-sides on the singles
from this album. Every one of them is great.

Maybe not quite as great as this album though, which is a definite 10.
