<p>Gothic/Doom Metal had it's prime time in the mid-nineties, after Paradise Lost and Type O Negative released
their blueprint albums and most bands trying to get a piece of the cake tried to sound similar to what was
already out in the wild. Originality was rare. The aproach of songwriting, the tone of the vocalists
the production - everything tried to sound like the "big ones".</p>
<p>Pyogenesis were a Death Metal band from Germany and Twinaleblood was their first proper Gothic Metal album after
they already had hints of the formula on 1994s <em>Sweet X-Rated Nothings</em>. At least this was the initial reaction of
most listeners - and then they realised this not being Gothic at all. In fact it's hardly Metal, but what is it
that irritated listeners back then and fascinates up to this day?</p>
<p>First of all we should try to find out why Pyogenesis had the Gothic label in the first place. 
Let's start with the instruments. The guitar tone sounds like stripped out of an Alternative Pop song, tuned down
to the bones and beefed up a bit to appear somewhat metal. The scales used are minor ones, but the melodies played
are uplifting which gives a bizarre soundscape that feels both happy and sad at the same time.
The mastering of the drums has a focus on base drum which also adds to the illusion of a Metal release until one
realises that there is no double bass on this album. Instead the whole drum sound reminds far more of Therapys
<em>Troublegum</em> than anything else.</p>
<p>Which brings us right to the vocals. There are two vocalists on this album. Florian Stangl provided the clean vocals,
highly melodic he is what makes one doubt the Metal background of the band in the first place. Tim Eiermann on the
other hand provided what first appeared to be growls. But as with the instruments those growls play their part just
like the instruments do, what first seemed to be proper Death Metal vocals are in fact just roughly sung lines for
the most part. There are some exceptions to this, e.g. <em>Abstract Life</em> and a few others do indeed contain real
growls.</p>
<p>To sum up the bizarre nature of this album: What appears to be a Death/Doom/Gothic album with oddly enjoyable
happy sounding melodies is in fact just a cleverly twisted Alternative Rock album that took inspiration from
the Gothic Metal of the times and managed to use those ingredients to spice up their outstanding ability to
write memoriable songs. And this is where <em>Twinaleblood</em> succeeds big time. Pyogenesis wrote hit after hit on
this release with choruses waiting to become part of your daily humming routines. Be it the acoustic <em>Emtpy Space</em>, 
<em>Those Churning Seas</em>, one of the most Metal songs on the album or the punky <em>Addiction Pole</em>, the band delivers.</p>
<p>So if you want your Metal to be more "alternative", if you are not afraid of big melodies, and if you want to hear
the first and most likely last Death Metal song on a Hip Hop beat (<em>Mutz umst erben</em>), give Twinaleblood a try.
It hasn't lost any of its charme even 22 years after its inception.</p>
<p>By the way: With their next output the band proved to be more rooted in Alternative music than in Metal by releasing
one of the poppiest Alternative Rock albums ever created, which was ironically called "Unpop". Also Tim later joined
Liquido, which some of you might know from their pathetic mainstream single <em>Narcotic</em>.</p>
