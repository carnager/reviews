Introducing British Theatre inevitably needs to mention Oceansize. A band that left a huge gap after their disbaning
in 2011. A band that had a fanatic following and deserved it. Their unusual mixture of punchy Post-Rock and complex
rhythms was not only unique, it was brilliant. Their debut album *Effloresque* is a total classic that needs to be known
by far more music enthusiasts. (Side note: Oceansize guitarist Steve Durose later joined Amplifier, a perfect fit)

Anyway. 2011. That was it. Four albums and a couple of EPs was all we ever got to hear from Oceansize. Or wasn't it?

Before Oceansize split, Mike Vennart established a side project with Richard "Gambler" Ingram called *British Theatre*, which after his main band finally
waved good-bye released two EPs, which showcased two worlds clashing: The guitar driven elements of Oceansize and the
chilling nature of electronic ambient. Impossible to find nowadays I yet have to hear those EPs, but they were received well
and they seemed to be all we got to hear from the band. 

In 2015 Vennart released his first solo album (featuring members of Oceansize) which basically continued his former bands path
but added quite some Pop appeal to what essentially was a Progressive Rock album. It seemed *British Theatre* was never to be heard
of again, just like it's originating band.

Fast forward another year. Financed via Pledgemusic (just like his solo album) the first proper *British Theatre* album was born.
And let's get this straight: This is all Oceansize fans could have asked for, while at the same time this will be seen as an
abnormination by many.

From the very first note, this album sounds like it's Mothership, the vocal melodies, the harmonies, the rhythms. When *Blue Horror*
starts playing one feels right at home. But yet there is something... different. It's not even obvious at first, but latest with
second track *The Cull* it becomes obvious: This is not a Rock album at all. Gone are the guitars, gone are the drums. The band instead
uses pure electronics to archive a very similar sound to what made Oceansize so special. Instead of drums there are programmed beats,
Synths play the role of guitars and bass and only the vocals are as organic as ever. 
And yet this thing works. And despite all missing elements this even works as the true successor to what fans thought to be lost forever.

Highlights definately include the formidable *Blue Horror* as well as *The Cull* or the light *Capra*, which serves well as a moment of
peace on a mostly quite dark album. Songs like *Newman* on the other hand show the new found love for electronics and take a step back from
the Rock-inspired sound, incorperating more straight up Electronic elements than most of the other tracks. Still Vennarts Voice and sense
for melody holds it all together and manages to never lose touch with his past as a member of one of the great ones.

So while the world got a bit darker in 2011 the future looks bright indeed, even though the medium has changed a bit.
